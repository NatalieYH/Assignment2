My name is Jae Sung Oh (s3807452) and came here from Korea when I was about 2. 
I love to play computer games from many different genres - mainly RTS, FPS, and MMORPG.
I also enjoy playing football (soccer) and of course, like many millenials, binge on Netflix. 
I have absolutely no experience in IT, but very keen to learn about it all. 
I’m particularly interested in AI and perhaps game development.
